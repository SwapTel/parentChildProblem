# Salesforce HandsOn Challenge: parentChildProblem

We have two objects ParentObject__c and ChildObject__c. The ChildObject__c (child) has master detail relationship with ParentObject__c (master). 
The both objects have a custom field named Amount__c but the Amount__c field on ChildObject__c should be calculated as follows.

ChildObject__c.Amount__c = (ParentObject__c.Amount__c / Total number of ChildObject__c records for ParentObject__c record)
